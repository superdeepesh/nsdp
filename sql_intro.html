        <h2>What is a database?</h2>
        <p>
          A database is a collection of information that is organized so that
          it can be easily accessed, managed and updated. Data is organized
          into rows, columns and tables, and it is indexed to make it easier
          to find relevant information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example</br>
          A Library database - It can store information about the books, authors,
          language, price and everything else important. Instead of walking around
          in a library, spending hours searching a book, you can easily consult a
          database and find the specific book you are looking for based on say the
          GENRE, or AUTHOR, or LANGUAGE, saving you a lot of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it is up to you to think about the uses of databases and other advantages.
        </p>

        <h2>What is SQL?</h2>
        <p>
          SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for <b>S</b>tructured <b>Q</b>uery
           <b>L</b>anguage.<br/><br/>
          Here are simple english definitions of each word:<br/>
          <b>Structured</b> - Structured is an adjective that comes from the noun structure, which is something that's been built or put together: usually, we think of a building being a structure. Anything that has been put together in an organized, deliberate way can be described as structured.<br/>
          <b>Query</b> - a question, especially one expressing doubt or requesting information.<br/>
          <b>Language</b> - the method of human communication, either spoken or written, consisting of the use of words in a structured and conventional way.<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
          SQL is a computer or programming language used to communicate with databases.
          It is the standard language used for relational databases management systems
          (database that has some relationsips between them).
        </p>

        <p>
          SQL statements like <code>SELECT * FROM myTableName</code> are used to perform tasks
          such as update data on a database, retrieve data, remove or manipulate data on a database.
        </p>

        <h2>What is RDBMS?</h2>
        <p>
          RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.<br/>
          Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are:
          <li>Oracle</li>
          <li>Sybase</li>
          <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
          <li>Access</li>
          <li>Ingres</li>
        </p>

        <p>Our Tutorial will cover the main statements used in all databases but
        we shall focus more on 'Microsoft SQL Server'.</p>

        <h2>What is a table?</h2>
        <p>In SQL a table is also called an OBJECT</p>
<pre>+-------+---------+-----+
| Name  | Surname | Age |
+-------+---------+-----+
| Clark | Kent    | 33  |
+-------+---------+-----+
| Bruce | Wayne   | 35  |
+-------+---------+-----+</pre>
        <p>A table contains COLUMNS.</p>
        <p>This is a column:</p>
        <pre>+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| Clark |
+-------+
| Bruce |
+-------+</pre>
        <p><code>Name</code> is known as the <b>field name</b></p>
        <p>This is another column:</p>
         <pre>+-----+
| Age |
+-----+
| 33  |
+-----+
| 35  |
+-----+</pre>
      <p><code>Age</code> is known as the <b>field name</b></p>

      <p>A table contains ROWS.</p>
      <p>This is a row:</p>
      <pre>+-------+------+----+
| Clark | Kent | 33 |
+-------+------+----+</pre>
      <p>This is another row:</p>
      <pre>+-------+-------+----+
| Bruce | Wayne | 35 |
+-------+-------+----+</pre>

      <p>When you execute a query, a result-set will be returned to you.</p>
      <p>Example: <code>SELECT * FROM mytable;</code> will return you the result-set:
        <pre>+-------+---------+-----+
| Name  | Surname | Age |
+-------+---------+-----+
| Clark | Kent    | 33  |
+-------+---------+-----+
| Bruce | Wayne   | 35  |
+-------+---------+-----+</pre>
      </p>
